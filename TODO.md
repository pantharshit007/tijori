- [ ] move the dashboard to dedicated route `/dashboard`.
- [ ] update the sidebar with the correct functionality, log out button, and settings button and profile, along with correct user info.
- [ ] do we need a profile page? what is even the use case for it?
- [ ] in `handleReveal` and `handleCopy` are we re-calculating the decrypted value every time? for each value? if yes, then we should cache it in state or fix it such that once we unlock the passcode, we don't need to decrypt the same value again.
- [ ] **Project Passcode Rotation**: Currently, changing a project's 6-digit passcode is not allowed.
  - **Reasoning**: It is a high-cost operation. Changing the passcode changes the PBKDF2 derived key, which would require re-encrypting EVERY variable in EVERY environment for that project, as well as re-encrypting all shared passcodes in the `sharedSecrets` table.
  - **Implementation Note**: If implemented, it must be performed as a client-side batch job (decrypt with old key, re-encrypt with new key) with a progress indicator and warning to the user.
- [ ] option to remove environments, only allowed to Owners, but Admin can create new Environment, but can't delete them. (also need to check if those vars are shared or not)
- [ ] add length limit to description field and other such fields in schema.
- [ ] update the enums such as "admin" and "member" to be "owner" and "member" in react files to types directly from convex.
- [ ] when removing a env key, instead of the alert we should get a dialog telling us the name and the environment where the key is used, which will get deleted.
- [ ] remove mutation in variable.ts `const variable = await ctx.db.get(args.id);` why are we querying the whole db again, instead of that specific table?
- [ ] Transfer ownership of project, pending.
- [ ] more options like select all, select none, and select few in shared section in dashboard to perform bulk actions, disable, expire, delete.
- [ ] add toast notifications for successful actions, ex: copy, delete, etc.
- [ ] add a role attribute to user table, role is whole platform based, role: user, pro, pro_plus, super_admin
  - [ ] continuation of the above, this will limit few things, ex: number of projects creation 5 or 10, no. of environments 3 or 5, no. of members per project 2 or 5, etc.
- [ ] remove the demo routes and data, but add the learning and knowledge base to the docs (learning.md).
